-- Test if lua_error is working as expected

-- Support these Lua C API items:
   -- lua_pushvfstring (varargs)
   -- lua_pushfstring (varargs)
   -- Whole lua_Debug API
   -- luaI_openlib (lua_Reg)
   -- luaL_openlib (lua_Reg)
   -- luaL_register (lua_Reg)
   -- luaL_error (varargs)
   -- luaL_checkoption (array of pointers)
   -- Whole luaL_Buffer API

-- Functions that take output pointers as parameters probably
   require wrappers to work at all. Check that and fix as needed.

-- Wrap API functions, that work with pointers, to handle JS-types
   (for example, register JS functions automatically).
   Support the raw data too, though, to keep things as flexible as possible.

-- Document the API
-- Split lua_c_api to three files, one per header. Load on demand.
-- Port <script type="text/lua"> from lua.vm.js (easy).
-- Port `js` object in Lua from lua.vm.js (probably needs a rewrite).
-- Write a proper Makefile.
-- Write a test suite (probably should use lua-TestMore for language compliance
   verification, and write new tests for C API).
-- Provide detailed and tested build instructions.
